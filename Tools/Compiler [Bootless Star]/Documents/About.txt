Shadowmaker Compiler
==================
------------------


Shadowmaker Compiler is designed to generate the Shadowmaker project directly from the version control directory.



Modifying:
--------------
Core:
    InitializationVars.bat

External Script:
    Compiler_Map.bat



Shadowmaker Compiler Project Detection:
--------------
The detection used in the compiler demands that the Compiler_Map must be in the project's root directory.  Thus, if the location of the core project is: "F:\SVNProjects\MyUltraCoolProject\Trunk\" then this is the directory that the script file must be in.



Prerequisites:
--------------
    7Zip
    Local Working Copy resources
