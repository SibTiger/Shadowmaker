Description             : This is my first attempt on making an Invasion map, hopefully it meets up to standards
                            and expectations of a traditional invasion game.  This map contains seven waves, in which 
                            the player will have to fight through mounds of demons and hellspawn.  To spice the waves 
                            up a bit, I have included different music to play through every few waves.
                          Moreover, this is a contribution submission to Zandronum's Community project:
                            Invasion Unleashed [ https://zandronum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=43155#p43155 ]
                          
                          Why is this map called Shadowmaker?  Primarily from this song by Apocalyptica: Shadowmaker

                          VIDEO RENDERER NOTES
                          -------------------------
                          OpenGL _IS_ required when playing this map.  This map utilizes dynamic lighting as a source
                            for lights and effects, as well as 3D Slopped Floors.
                          
                          
                          
                          PERFORMANCE NOTES
                          -------------------------
                            This map might be rather resource and rendering
                            intensive on various systems abroad.  Here is a
                            few Console Variables that could help a bit by
                            disabling some special features based on the
                            Zandronum [GZDoom] engine:
                                Line Mirrors (Software Renderer)
                                    R_DrawMirrors [True|False]
                                Line Mirrors (OpenGL Renderer)
                                    GL_Mirrors [True|False]
                                Sector Reflections
                                    GL_Plane_Reflection [True|False]
                                Dynamic Lights
                                    GL_Lights [True|False]

                                    R_DrawTrans [True|False]
                                Toggle Rendering Precision
                                    GL_Render_Precise [True|False]
